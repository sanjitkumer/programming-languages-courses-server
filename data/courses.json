But on Fox News, what Tucker says goes."

Ricciardo’s departure at the end of the season was confirmed by McLaren in August. The Perth-born driver was not performing up to expectations and the Surrey-based outfit decided to pull the plug early. This was not a popular decision, as many people including Sebastian Vettel and Lewis Hamilton felt that the 33-year-old should have gotten more time. For now, he is without an F1 seat but he’s too valuable a driver to remain on the sidelines. Strong rumors have linked him back to a move to Alpine. Team boss Otmar Szafnauer has not confirmed anything as of yet, but he remains the favorite. This is especially because their junior driver Oscar Piastri, who was first choice to replace Fernando Alonso at the team is reportedly on his way to McLaren. There are some other teams who are interested in securing the services of Ricciardo. Both him and Haas team principal Guenther Steiner recently admitted that they held talks about their 2023 seat a few weeks ago. A decision regarding his future in F1 is expected to be announced very soon.

        "details": "On Thursday night’s episode of Up Late, Ben Harvey has suggested Troy Mercanti start an OnlyFans account if he wishes to challenge anti-consorting laws. The notorious bikie will fight allegations that he broke WA’s stringent anti-consorting and insignia laws — but is also watching a High Court challenge to the regulations which the State Government have touted have the nation’s toughest against outlaw motorcycle gang members. The long-time one per center was not in court on Wednesday when the not guilty pleas were entered. WATCH UP LATE IN THE VIDEO PLAYER ABOVE But his lawyer Paul Holmes was, who revealed that Mercanti’s defence will be on two fronts — against elements of the alleged offence, and the legislation itself. Mercanti was charged with the two offences outside an Italian restaurant in front of shocked onlookers earlier this year. According to eyewitnesses, Mercanti — dressed in a T-shirt and shorts — was having lunch with long-time friend John Kizon at Mt Hawthorn’s Lupo Lab when more than a dozen officers from the gang crime squad descended and asked him to step outside. Soon afterwards, he was told he was being charged via summons with displaying gang insignia, which was prohibited under sweeping laws that came into effect a few months ago. Earlier the same week, Mercanti was hit with a dispersal notice by police while picking up a friend at the airport. Mercanti’s case was adjourned until October to be allocated a trial date. On Up Late, Harvey warned fighting in court may get expensive for Mercanti, and suggested a way he may be able to come up with the cash. Harvey may have gotten the idea after it was this week revealed that Dhakota Williams — the 21-year-old daughter of slain underworld king Carl Williams started an OnlyFans account. “If it’s good enough for the wife and daughter of slain gangland boss Carl Williams then it’s gotta be good enough for Troy Mercanti,” Harvey says. “See Troy’s OnlyFans page for exclusive tips for how a modern outlaw can best accessorise… find out why black and white are the only colours you need in your wardrobe… a showcase of latest leather trends… tips on keeping healthy. “And exclusively for OnlyFans subscribers... an inside look at the man who put the soft into soft serve, how he relaxes listing to 80s glam-rock and some cosplay as a Lego spaceman.”"
